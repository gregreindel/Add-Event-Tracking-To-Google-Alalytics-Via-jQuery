Google Analytics Event Tracking Added Automatically With jQuery
=================================

Author: <a href="http://www.gregreindel.com">Greg Reindel</a>
Current Version: 1.0

Automatically add basic Google Analytics event tracking using jQuery. I wrote it for use on this site, but the script can be used as is or modified to suite your needs.

You can either:

    -Add the code to an existing theme JavaScript file that is called on every page (or the pages you want to track events)
    -Add the code to the footer of the every page before the closing body tag () (or the pages you want to track events)
    -Download the script and include it on every page (..and again â€“ or the pages you want to track events)
